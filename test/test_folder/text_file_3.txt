Hi John,

Hope you're doing well! I just wanted to let you know that I'm selling a variety of cars now â€” from sporty models to family-friendly SUVs and efficient electric rides.

Here are just a few options available right now:

    Midnight Blue Tesla Model Y: Stylish, tech-packed, and eco-friendly.
    Ruby Red Toyota RAV4: Perfect for road trips and daily commutes.
    Classic Black BMW 3 Series: Sophistication meets performance.

If you're thinking of upgrading your ride or know someone who might be interested, feel free to reach out. I'd be happy to help you find the perfect match!

Take care and stay in touch,
