Hey John,

Hope you're doing great! Just wanted to share some exciting news — I finally bought a new car! It’s a sleek midnight blue Tesla Model Y, and I’m absolutely loving it. The smooth electric drive and tech-packed interior make every ride feel futuristic.

I’m already planning a few weekend trips to break it in. Let me know if you want to go for a spin sometime!

What’s new on your end? Hope all is good with you.

Take care,
