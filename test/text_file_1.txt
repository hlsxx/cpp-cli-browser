Hey John,

Hope you're doing well! Just wanted to share some exciting weekend plans — I'm heading to a car race with a few friends. It’s going to be an adrenaline-packed day filled with roaring engines, sharp turns, and fierce competition.

We’ve been hyped about this for weeks, and I can’t wait to see some of my favorite cars in action. I’ll be sure to snap some pics and share the highlights with you!

What are you up to this weekend? Let’s catch up soon!

Take care,
